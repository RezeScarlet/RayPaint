# RayPaint
A painting app made with [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), it's C++ and [Raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) in collaboration with [Alo√≠sio](https://github.com/laosioor) for [David Buzatto](https://github.com/davidbuzatto)'s Data Structure Class.  

I will make a version using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui?tab=readme-ov-file) and [rlImGui](https://github.com/raylib-extras/rlImGui) to try it out.
